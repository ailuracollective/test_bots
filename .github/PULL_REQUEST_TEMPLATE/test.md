# Tests

Use when the primary purpose is test coverage. If the pull request also changes runtime code to
make a test pass, it is a `fix` or a `feat`.

Say what the suite now guarantees that it did not before. Coverage that does not change a
guarantee is not worth the maintenance cost.

## Linked issue (required)

<!-- The issue must carry `status/ready`. Use a closing keyword on its own line; `Refs #N` does not close it. -->

Closes #

## Type (required)

<!-- Check one. The title type and the label differ: twelve title types, five `type/*` labels. -->

- [ ] `test`

<!-- `type/task` is the catch-all label for this type. -->

## Scope of this change

<!-- Which behavior is under test here, and why it is separated from the change that introduced it. -->

## Now covered

<!-- The scenarios that are covered and were not before. Name the cases, not the files. -->

## Existing coverage that moved

<!-- Tests renamed, moved, merged or deleted, and where their coverage went. -->

## Deliberately uncovered

<!-- What you chose not to test, and why. -->

## Fixtures and mocks

<!-- How the test isolates its subject (fixtures, doubles, clock); note any ordering or shared state. -->

## Test plan

<!-- The checks this repository's CI runs: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. -->
<!-- Run `uv sync --locked` first; every command below lives in that workflow. -->

- [ ] `uv run yamllint .`
- [ ] `uv run mdlint check . .github`
- [ ] `uv run actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml` (workflow changes only)
- [ ] `uv run yamlfix --check -i '*.yml' -e '.cache/**' -e '.github/standards.local.example.yml' .`
- [ ] Manually exercised the change end to end
