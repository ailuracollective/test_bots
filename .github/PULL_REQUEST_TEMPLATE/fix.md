# Bug fix

Use for correcting incorrect behavior. If the behavior was never correct and is being newly
defined, that is a `feat`.

Show the defect with evidence. The root cause is what stops it recurring, so do not stop at the
symptom.

## Linked issue (required)

<!-- The issue must carry `status/ready`. Use a closing keyword on its own line; `Refs #N` does not close it. -->
